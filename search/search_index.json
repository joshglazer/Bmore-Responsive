A simple, flexible API to support emergency response coordination. Sample use cases include: keeping track of local nursing home status and needs during a global pandemic identifying hospitals lacking power during a natural disaster assuring safety of hikers in a national park during a snow storm This system will make use of digital services and modern methodologies to automate and simplify parts of the check-in process to help the municipality prioritize its call/check-in list and response plan. Additionally, the system will validate contact information regularly during non-emergency times to ensure the municipality has the most up-to-date information for each entity. What does it do? Bmore-Responsive provides the following primary features via a secure REST API: Maintain set of Entities (could be hospitals, nursing homes, campers, etc) Maintain set of Contacts for Entities (people who can provide status/need info for entities) Capture of status/need information about Entities User account and role management to enable secure authentication and authorization Export of any data via CSV How do I use it? You can begin using Bmore-Responsive in minutes by following our the steps in the Quick Start Guide . If you have more advanced installation/configuration needs take a look at out Slow Start Guide . Once you've installed the app, check out the How To Use Guide to understand the use the API directly or integrate a front end application. How is it built? Can I contribute? Bmore-Responsive is an Open Source project developed mostly in node.js. You are welcome to fork the repo to customize for your own needs, but we'd welcome contributions to improve Bmore Responsive directly. For more technical detail on the solution and guidance on contributing, please see our Developers' Guide .

Provide meaningful code comments All commits must include a useful commit message Style Guides Consistent style guidelines for each language should be used. Where possible, openly published standards by authorities providing or using the language will be used. Example: Google has openly published style guides for many languages in wide use on their open source projects, and these can be adopted for use in this project: Google Language Specific Styleguides Static Code Analysis Static code analysis tools should be used when possible, to monitor and improve code quality. This may be integrated in the local development environment, automated repository commit checks, automated CI/CD pipelines, or other steps in the code development process. Git and Branching All code work should be done in an isolated or feature branch off of the master branch. Before starting work on new code, developers should create their feature branch using a standard naming convention determined by the project. Branch Names Branch names should follow this pattern: your github username /issue- github issue number . This will ensure there are no branch name conflicts, and anyone looking for your branch will know what it is called based on the issue addressed. For example if your username was letsGoOs , and you were working on issue 8, then your branch name would be letsGoOs/issue-8 . If you wanted to make a new branch to continue your work on your issue then add a suffix with an incremented number. To continue the previous example if you wanted to make a second branch for your issue 8 work your second branch would be called letsGoOs/issue-8-2 . Merging and Pull Requests When work is complete, and after static code analysis has been performed, the developer should submit a pull request in Github. A pull request template has been provided, and developers should take care to fill out the form as completely as possible when submitting new pull requests omitting any sections that are deemed unnecessary for that particular submission. Pull requests should require at least 1 review from another verified team member before they are approved and merged into the master branch. While not strictly required, it is recommended that pull requests are submitted early on in the development process with the intention of maintaining high visibility over the work while it is in progress.","title":"Best Practices"},{"location":"Best_Practices/#best-practices","text":"Here's an incomplete list of things that are inportant to consider when developing code to be controibuted to Bmore Responsive:","title":"Best Practices"},{"location":"Best_Practices/#code-quality-standards","text":"Regardless of Language: Default to lowerCamelCase naming convention Use static code analysis tools to improve code quality and consistency Code modifications within a repository should be performed on a branch, that will be merged to master via a pull request once approved.

This page will provide an introduction the to the architecture, implementation and processes of Bmore Responsive. Components This application will be broken down into several components. Each will be outlined here. Application Architecture The overall application will have several components in support of the code. These will facilitate secure communication between any front end, our API, and the data layer. Additionally our architecture will be designed to be scalable for instances of heavy load. API The API is the application for all intents and purposes. Use of the API and possible paths of use are defined in the flowchart below. CI/CD We will use TravisCI, Docker, Netlify, and AWS to provide constant code deployments and test coverage. Data This product makes use of PostgreSQL for the data layer and Sequelize for database interactions. Our database documentation can be found in the /sequelize directory or you can click here . The schema is outlined below Migrations Migrations are the scripts to create tables and initialize the database. Migrations can be written to run after the initial migration takes place. It is important to note that the migrations run in sequential order, so using a numbering system is important. It is also important to note that FK columns and relationships can be and should be defined as their own migrations. This is to prevent errors of columns being created when the parent table no longer exists. Individual migrations can be reverted as per the Sequelize documentation. Data Seeders A seeder is a script to seed a particular set of data. As with Migrations these scripts run in order, so numbering is important. Because of FK constraints it is again important to note when data is seeded to prevent errors with FK constraints. Imports can be chained in a single seed script, and this may be useful and advised for seeded data that is related through a FK. To create new models, migrations, and seeders you must use the Sequelize CLI commands. Full documentation is here https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html but here are a few useful commands: npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes firstName:string,lastName:string,email:string - Creates a model under /src/models and a migration script. npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name demo-user - Creates a seeder for the User model and migration previously setup. NPM commands This repo has simplified a few of the Sequelize CLI options that would be commonly used by this project. npm run db-create will create the database and run all migrations. npm run db-delete will delete all tables and revert all migrations. npm run db-seed will run all seeders and populate all data. npm run db-unseed will delete all data in all tables and revert all seeders. Role and Access Mgmt User role management is being handled by Casbin . To facilitate this our migrations and seeding will replicate the casbin_rule table that would be generated by the casbin-sequelize package. We are then seeding as normal, however the field names are not straight-forward. They are defined as follows: role = The plain-text name of the role. Example: admin path = The path the role has access to. Example: /user method = The http method that can be hit. Example GET For use and management of roles after seeding, please refer to the API spec or Casbin Node.js documentation.","title":"Developer Overview"},{"location":"DevIntro/#components","text":"This application will be broken down into several components.

This API spec lists all the endpoints, supported REST actions, and the request and response data formats. While you can open the swagger.json file in any text editor, there are better ways to view it in a richer format, such as: View the API Spec on Swaggerhub If you are running Bmore Responsive, then you can just point your browser at the root URL of your server, often http://localhost:3000/ , you'll be redirected to http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ Postman Collection For a library of sample API calls, please refer to the Postman collection Bmore-Responsive.postman_collection.json . Need Postman? Click here . Authentication The Bmore Responsive API provides security by limiting use of nearly all features to authenticated users. If you have NOT disabled login, you'll need to pass a JSON Web Token (JWT) with every call to a secured endpoint. Only the login ( /user/login ) and health ( /health ) endpoints are unsecured. To get a JWT, you'll need to pass a valid username and password to /user/login ; the encoded JWT is the response body. This JWT should be passed as the Authorization header using the Bearer authentication scheme . This token will expire after a short period of time. If it expires, you can get a new token by making another call to user/login . Note: If you have used the db-seed script, you'll already have a user account created that will enable you to login. This default login is username homer.simpson@sfpp.com and password donuts . Seed and re-seed the database This repo has four scripts that simplifies the creation and loading of the database. These script commands are as follows: npm run db-create will create the database and run all migrations. npm run db-delete will delete all tables and revert all migrations. npm run db-seed will run all seeders and populate database with random, Simpsons-like data. npm run db-unseed will delete all data in all tables and revert all seeders.","title":"Users Guide"},{"location":"HowToUse/#api-spec","text":"The Bmore Responsive API is documented via a OAS 3.0 API specification in the file swagger.json .

The approach below is just one way to get Bmore Responsive running. For other approaches and more detail on configuration, please see the Slow Start Guide section of the Users' Guide. Step 0 - Download code from github We're assuming that you've cloned or downloaded the contents of the Bmore Responsive repository on GitHub . Step 1 - Install Required Software In order to follow this quick start guide you'll need to make sure you have the following software installed on your machine: Node.js - You can confirm you have Node.js by executing node -v at a command line. If your machine replies with a version number like 13.8.0 then you have Node.js installed. If you need to install Node.js, head on over to Nodejs.org . Note: Currently, there is known incompatibility with Node v14.X that prevents DB connectivity. DO NOT USE Node v14.x. Docker Desktop with DockerHub access - Docker is not technically required to run BMore Responsive, but this guide uses Docker to get up and running quickly. You can confirm that you have Docker Desktop by executing docker -v at a command line. If your machine replies with a version number like Docker version 19.03.8, build afaca4b then you have Docker Desktop installed. If you need to install Docker Desktop, head on over to the Docker Desktop page . Step 2 - Install Open your terminal, change to your Bmore-Responsive directory (created in Step 0) then run npm install Step 3 - Configure Your Environment You'll need to create a text file named .env in your Bmore-Responsive directory. This file set initial values of your environment variables. NODE_ENV=development PORT=3000 JWT_KEY=test123 DATABASE_HOST=localhost DATABASE_PORT=5432 DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres DATABASE_NAME=postgres DATABASE_SCHEMA=public BYPASS_LOGIN=true Note: The settings above assume that your username and password for your DB are both postgres . We highly recommend changing these values in this step and the following step. Step 4 - Start Up a Database Use Docker to start up a PostgreSQL database with the following command: docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres Note: If you changed your username or password in the previous step, you'll need to replace values in this command to match. Step 5 - Create and Seed Database In order to create the necessary database tables run npm run db-create . To populate the DB with sample users, entities and contacts that may resemble the fictional world of The Simpsons just run npm run db-seed . Step 6 - Run Server To run the application run npm start . Your terminal output should end with a line like Bmore Responsive is available at http://localhost:3000 Step 7 - Confirm Success To confirm the server is running, just point your browser to http://localhost:3000/entity (or just add \"/entity\" to the URL from the previous step). A response like the sample below lets you know your server is healthy. { _meta : { total : 25 }, results : [ { id : 376fb5a1-d8fe-42ce-9492-cca41148ff1a , name : The Leftorium , type : Test , address : { street : [ 123 Anyplace St. ], ...

Configuring via Environment variables Regardless of where you are running the system, environment variables to run this application. These variables are set in the .env file on the root directory of Bmore Responsive. The various variables are defined as follows: NODE_ENV = The label for your environment. It can be anything you want and will allow you to differentiate multiple instances. PORT = The local port you wish to run on. Defaults to 3000 DATABASE_HOST = The database host PostgreSQL is running on, which can be specified as a (sub)domain or IP address DATABASE_PORT = The database port PostgreSQL is running on DATABASE_USERNAME = The username for connecting to PostgreSQL DATABASE_PASSWORD = The password for connecting to PostgreSQL DATABASE_NAME = The name of the PostgreSQL database to connect to DATABASE_SCHEMA = Your local database schema. PostgreSQL default is public . JWT_KEY = A secret value to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) locally. SMTP_HOST = optional hostname for the SMTP server used to send notification emails SMTP_PORT = optional port number for the SMTP server used to send notification emails SMTP_USER = optional username for the SMTP server used to send notification emails SMTP_PASSWORD = optional password for the SMTP server used to send notification emails BYPASS_LOGIN = optional Allows you to hit the endpoints locally without having to login. If you wish to bypass the login process during local dev, set this to true . Note: at the moment, login will be bypassed if this variable simply exists in the .env file. Even BYPASS_LOGIN = false will remove the need to login. To require login, simply remove mention of this variable from this file. We do not recommend using the default options for PostgreSQL. The above values are provided as examples. It is more secure to create your own credentials. Deploying to AWS If you want to deploy to AWS, we have included a terraform option. For more information on how to use this feature, please see the README in /terraform . SMTP To send emails with the system you will need to setup your SMTP sever and set the relevant SMTP_* variables. For testing we recommend using Ethereal Running in Docker You can build and run the application in Docker locally by running the following commands: docker build -t bmoreres . docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file=.env bmoreres Note that the DATABASE_HOST values will be different depending on what OS you're using. On Mac it is docker.for.mac.host.internal and on Windows it is docker.for.win.host.internal if using docker-compose it will be db . Please see Example .env for more information. Alternatively you can manually set the environment variables and not use a .env file by setting the following vars: -e NODE_ENV=development -e PORT=3000 -e JWT_KEY= your JWT phrase -e DATABASE_HOST= your database port -e DATABASE_PORT= your database host -e DATABASE_USERNAME= your database username -e DATABASE_PASSWORD= your database user password -e DATABASE_NAME= your database name -e DATABASE_DATABASE_SCHEMA= your database schema docker-compose To use the docker-compose.yml file included you will first need to set environment variables . You MUST set your DATABASE_HOST to db to use the docker-compose solution. It is not recommended to use docker-compose for any reason other than to test a solution for a separate front-end component. Warning : If you are running Docker Toolbox instead of Docker Desktop (likely meaning you are running Windows 10 Home, not Professional) you will need to change your .env to reflect Docker running on a VM: DATABASE_HOST : The IP address Docker is running on.

What is Bmore Responsive? A simple, flexible API to support emergency response coordination. Sample use cases include: keeping track of local nursing home status and needs during a global pandemic identifying hospitals lacking power during a natural disaster assuring safety of hikers in a national park during a snow storm This system will make use of digital services and modern methodologies to automate and simplify parts of the check-in process to help the municipality prioritize its call/check-in list and response plan. Additionally, the system will validate contact information regularly during non-emergency times to ensure the municipality has the most up-to-date information for each entity. What Bmore Responsive Isn't? In order to stay focus on its primary goals, Bmore Responsive is not intended to: Be a front-end website or app Provide statistical or analytical endpoints Be a robust questionnaire design tool Roadmap The project team uses a User Story Map to identify feature planned for future development. Here's our latest story map: Bmore Responsive User Story Map Current Work We use GitHub issues to define and manage our work. The list of open issues describes the work that is currently on our plate. GitHub milestones are occasionally used to represent features from the story map. Often several issues (user stories, bugs, tasks, etc) will be related to one feature. By relating these issues to a milestone, it makes it easy to view/track progress toward features on the story map.
